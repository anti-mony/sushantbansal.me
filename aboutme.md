<i class="fa fa-briefcase">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>I'm currently a Data Analytics (ML) intern at the Enrico Fermi Institute, University of Chicago. I work with the network measurement data collected by the [perfSONAR](https://www.perfsonar.net/about/) toolkit across the WLCG ad OSG.

<i class="fas fa-user-graduate">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>Enrolled in the Masters Program in Computer Science (*Data Analytics Track*) at the University of Chicago. I started in September 2018 and expect to graduate in December 2019. Also, I got my under graduate degree in Computer Science and Engineering at Shiv Nadar University, India from 2014 to 2018.

<i class="fas fa-book">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>I'm currently reading the book **1984** by *George Orwell*. And I'm bummed by the similarities in teh current world and the book. 

<i class="fas fa-music">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>I absolutely enjoy listening to music. My favorite artist is *John Mayer* but I also like *Coldplay, Guns and Roses, James Bay, The Local Train* and various *Lo-fi* artists.

<i class="fas fa-history">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>I grew up in New Delhi, India, Hindi is my native language and I got my first computer when I was in 1st grade. Star Wars (trial version) is the first game that I can remember that I played on a computer, at that time I didn't know about Star Wars. And I moved to the windy city Chicago in September 2018.
